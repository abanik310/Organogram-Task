Background:
A service provider company has different departments and each department provides different
services. The employee role hierarchy is the same throughout all the departments. An employee
can be assigned to different roles in different departments. Here are the key notes about the
company structure.
1. Department: Department can be a single entity, it is independent.
2. Role: Role always follows hierarchy. Here are the roles:
CEO➞ COO➞ GENERAL MANAGER➞ MANAGER➞ SUPERVISOR➞ STAFF
There could be many more roles after this.
3. Employee: Employee can be assigned to multiple departments with different roles. E.g. if
EMPLOYEE 1 has been assigned to DEPARTMENT 1 with role MANAGER. The same
employee can be assigned to another department with a different role.

This is just an example. Here you can find organogram for only two departments but there can be
more. You can notice that EMP-1 is the CEO in Department A but General manager in Department
B. Another example: EMP-30 is Supervisor in Department A but is Staff in Department B. This way
an employee can hold different roles in different departments.
